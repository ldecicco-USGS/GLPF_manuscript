## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
# Results {#results}

Results \@ref(fig:figure_2).

```{r figure_2, fig.cap="Figure 2. Human bacteria marker A. concentrations and b. Occurrence proportion in samples from small storm sewers and open channels (Small), subwatersheds of the Milwakee River (Subwatersheds), and tributaries of the Great Lakes (Watershed)", echo=FALSE}
#source(file = file.path("plots","src","Figure_2.R"))
#fig_2 <- plot_fig_2()
print(fig_2)

```

Points to make with this figure:
1. Wisconsin small scale had samples with max concentrations and were generally higher than other sites
2. Many sites had greater concentrations during runoff events. This is true for the watersheds and subwatersheds that had substantial urban influence. 
3. Small scale sites
