```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,
                      warning = FALSE, 
                      message = FALSE)
```

# EEM plot {#EEM}

Maybe we want to show a particular EEM plot...such as Figure \@ref(fig:eem-example).

```{r eem-example, fig.cap="Here is a EEM plot.", echo=FALSE}
print(EEMplot)

```

Pretty neat.
