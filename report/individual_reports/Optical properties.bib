	abstract = {The fluorescent properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) are often studied in order to infer DOM characteristics in aquatic environments, including source, quantity, composition, and behavior. While a potentially powerful technique, a single widely implemented standard method for correcting and presenting fluorescence measurements is lacking, leading to difficulties when comparing data collected by different research groups. This paper reports on a large-scale interlaboratory comparison in which natural samples and well-characterized fluorophores were analyzed in 20 laboratories in the U.S., Europe, and Australia. Shortcomings were evident in several areas, including data quality-assurance, the accuracy of spectral correction factors used to correct EEMs, and the treatment of optically dense samples. Data corrected by participants according to individual laboratory procedures were more variable than when corrected under a standard protocol. Wavelength dependency in measurement precision and accuracy were observed within and between instruments, even in corrected data. In an effort to reduce future occurrences of similar problems, algorithms for correcting and calibrating EEMs are described in detail, and MATLAB scripts for implementing the study’s protocol are provided. Combined with the recent expansion of spectral fluorescence standards, this approach will serve to increase the intercomparability of DOM fluorescence studies.},

	abstract = {Highly resolved time series data are useful to accurately identify the timing, rate, and magnitude of solute transport in streams during hydrologically dynamic periods such as snowmelt. We used in situ optical sensors for nitrate (NO3 −) and chromophoric dissolved organic matter fluorescence (FDOM) to measure surface water concentrations at 30 min intervals over the snowmelt period (March 21–May 13, 2009) at a 40.5 hectare forested watershed at Sleepers River, Vermont. We also collected discrete samples for laboratory absorbance and fluorescence as well as δ18O–NO3 − isotopes to help interpret the drivers of variable NO3 − and FDOM concentrations measured in situ. In situ data revealed seasonal, event and diurnal patterns associated with hydrological and biogeochemical processes regulating stream NO3 − and FDOM concentrations. An observed decrease in NO3 − concentrations after peak snowmelt runoff and muted response to spring rainfall was consistent with the flushing of a limited supply of NO3 − (mainly from nitrification) from source areas in surficial soils. Stream FDOM concentrations were coupled with flow throughout the study period, suggesting a strong hydrologic control on DOM concentrations in the stream. However, higher FDOM concentrations per unit streamflow after snowmelt likely reflected a greater hydraulic connectivity of the stream to leachable DOM sources in upland soils. We also observed diurnal NO3 − variability of 1–2 μmol l−1 after snowpack ablation, presumably due to in-stream uptake prior to leafout. A comparison of NO3 − and dissolved organic carbon yields (DOC, measured by FDOM proxy) calculated from weekly discrete samples and in situ data sub-sampled daily resulted in small to moderate differences over the entire study period (−4 to 1\% for NO3 − and −3 to −14\% for DOC), but resulted in much larger differences for daily yields (−66 to +27\% for NO3 − and −88 to +47\% for DOC, respectively). Despite challenges inherent in in situ sensor deployments in harsh seasonal conditions, these data provide important insights into processes controlling NO3 − and FDOM in streams, and will be critical for evaluating the effects of climate change on snowmelt delivery to downstream ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Advances in spectroscopic techniques have led to an increase in the use of optical measurements (absorbance and fluorescence) to assess dissolved organic matter composition and infer sources and processing. Although optical measurements are easy to make, they can be affected by many variables rendering them less comparable, including by inconsistencies in sample collection (for example, filter pore size, preservation), the application of corrections for interferences (for example, inner-filtering corrections), differences in holding times, and instrument drift (for example, lamp intensity). A documented, standardized procedure to address these variables ensures that the optical (absorbance and fluorescence) measurements collected by U.S. Geological Survey researchers are useful and widely comparable.Rigorous and quantifiable quality assurance and quality control are essential for making these data comparable, particularly because there is no published guideline for the measurement of dissolved organic matter absorbance and fluorescence, and especially because there is no National Institute of Standards and Technology standard for dissolved organic matter. Validation and quality-control samples are analyzed on a monthly basis to determine laboratory and instrument precision and daily (that is, each day samples are run) to ensure repeatability. Data are not considered acceptable unless they meet laboratory criteria: All standards should be within 10 percent of the target value, laboratory replicates should be within 5 percent relative percent difference, and laboratory blanks (that is, laboratory reagent-grade water) should be less than one-tenth of the long-term method detection limit.Finally, for data to be useful, they must be accessible to users in a format that can be easily analyzed and interpreted. The Organic Matter Research Laboratory staff has developed a processing routine that extracts a subset of the data, which is made available to the public through the USGS National Water Quality Information System (http://nwis.waterdata.usgs.gov/usa/nwis/qwdata), and organizes the full datasets (that is, complete absorbance spectra and fluorescence excitation-emission matrices) in different forms that allow for these data to be analyzed using multi-parameter and multi-way statistical approaches.},

	abstract = {Phytoplankton are critical component of the food web in most large rivers and estuaries, and thus identifying dominant controls on phytoplankton abundance and species composition is important to scientists, managers, and policymakers. Recent studies from a variety of systems indicate that ammonium ( ) in treated wastewater effluent decreases primary production and alters phytoplankton species composition. However, these findings are based mainly on laboratory and enclosure studies, which may not adequately represent natural systems. To test effects of effluent high in ammonium on phytoplankton at the ecosystem scale, we conducted whole-river–scale experiments by halting discharges to the Sacramento River from the regional wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), and used a Lagrangian approach to compare changes in phytoplankton abundance and species composition in the presence (+EFF) and absence (−EFF) of effluent. Over 5 d of downstream travel from 20 km above to 50 km below the WWTP, chlorophyll concentrations declined from 15–25 to ∼2.5 μg L−1, irrespective of effluent addition. Benthic diatoms were dominant in most samples. We found no significant difference in phytoplankton abundance or species composition between +EFF and −EFF conditions. Moreover, greatest declines in chlorophyll occurred upstream of the WWTP where concentrations were low. Grazing by clams and zooplankton could not account for observed losses, suggesting other factors such as hydrodynamics and light limitation were responsible for phytoplankton declines. These results highlight the advantages of conducting ecosystem-scale, Lagrangian-based experiments to understand the dynamic and complex interplay between physical, chemical, and biological factors that control phytoplankton populations.},

	abstract = {Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is critically important for catchment biogeochemical cycling, yet the DOM dynamics of many river systems remain poorly characterized. Recently, DOM mobilization and transport in forested and agricultural catchments have received increased attention; however, for urban catchments, our understanding of spatio-temporal variability in DOM concentration and composition is very limited. This is a particular concern as urbanization can increase and alter labile DOM fluxes leading to a shift from downstream transport of stream carbon to increased microbial production and respiration of stream carbon in headwaters. Furthermore, the anthropogenic modification of the water cycle and the flashy hydrology of urban rivers have constrained attempts to characterize intra- and inter-seasonal variability in DOM across the spectrum from low to storm flows. In this focus article, we synthesize the contemporary literature on urban DOM sources, flow paths, and spatio-temporal variability and present a conceptual model to unravel system dynamics and inform future monitoring efforts. The potential of field deployable fluorescence sensor technology to overcome monitoring challenges in urban rivers is highlighted. We use a case study of a relatively well-studied UK urban river to illustrate the potential of in situ fluorescence to reveal DOM dynamics in a system with marked inter-event variability in DOM sources and pathways. Finally, we outline future directions for this research, particular the need to standardize field and laboratory protocols and advance new sensor development.

The method is based on second-order multivariate calibration applying three-way chemometric methods. Due to unique solutions of the three-way data analysis methods and analogy between the structure of LABS and OB, it is apparent that these methods can resolve overlapping signals into pure spectra and relative concentration profiles. Satisfactory recoveries for the spiked laundry powders for LABS (92.8–109.3\%) and OB (97.1–105.2\%) indicate the high accuracies of the proposed calibration methods for the assessment of LABS and OB in laundry powders. In the case of environmental samples, recoveries of 98.0–109.3\% for LABS and 94.0–107.7\% for OB show that the present method successfully faces this complex challenge without the necessity of applying separation steps.},

This fluorescence was dominated by tryptophan fluorescence and a fluorescence center possibly due to the presence of fluorescent whitening agents. In contrast, the three other rivers exhibited lower fluorescence intensities typical of river systems with tryptophan (sewage), humic-like (peat derived color), and fulvic-like (natural organic matter) sources.

The PARAFAC analysis modeled seven fluorescence components: tryptophan-like, tyrosine-like, and five humic substance-like components. For most of the plant-derived DOM solutions, decomposition significantly affected the concentration of three humic substance-like-associated components, increasing two and decreasing one. The effect of decomposition upon DOM derived from animal manures was dependent on the manure source. For a majority of the DOM extracts, the ratio of fluorescence intensity to absorptivity at 254 nm increased following decomposition, indicating that fluorescing DOM compounds were generally more resistant to biodegradation than nonfluorescing UV-absorbing compounds. Molar absorptivity, humification index (HIX), and apparent molecular weight (MWAP) increased by 38.0, 38.8, and 370\%, respectively, following decomposition. Spearman correlation analysis showed a strong positive relationship between the humic substance-like components and the DOM MWAP, absorptivity, and HIX. The results of this study support the use of multidimensional fluorescence spectroscopy with PARAFAC as a method to monitor the decomposition of carbon-rich soil amendments such as crop residues, green manures, and animal manures.},

To test the feasibility of the use fluorescent techniques to detect fecal contamination, fluorescence excitation and emission characteristics of fecal matter from cows, deer,swine, chickens, and turkeys in the UV to far-red regions of the spectrum were evaluated. To allow the optimization of the detection of fecal contamination on animal carcasses and cut meats, emission-excitation spectra of the feces were compared with spectra for animal meats. The feedstuffs for the swine, chickens, and turkeys were also analyzed. Excitation at approximately 410 to 420 nm yielded the highest level of fluorescence for both feces and feedstuffs. Emission maxima were in the red region (at 632 nm for chicken feces and at 675 nm for the feces of the other species). The major constituent responsible for emission at 632 nm was tentatively identified as protoporphyrin IX; emission at 675 nm most likely emanates from chlorophyll a or its metabolites. Animal meats emitted strong fluorescence in the blue-green regions, but no emission peaks were observed in the red region for these meats. These results suggest that fluorescence emissions from naturally occurring chlorophyll a and its metabolites are good markers for fecal contamination and that with excitation at 410 to 420 nm, the responses of fecal matter can easily be differentiated from the responses of animal meats. We suggest that the detection of fecal contamination can be enhanced by requiring a minimum chlorophyll a content in the finishing diets of all farm animals.},

fluxes may also be large. We used a novel approach to estimate export
of DOC, Hg, and MeHg to coastal waters from a mangrove-dominated estuary
in Everglades National Park (Florida, USA). Using in situ measurements
of fluorescent dissolved organic matter as a proxy for DOC, filtered
total Hg, and filtered MeHg, we estimated the DOC yield to be 180
(±12.6) g C m–2 yr–1, which
is in the range of previously reported values. Although Hg and MeHg
yields from tidal mangrove swamps have not been previously measured,
our estimated yields of Hg species (28 ± 4.5 μg total Hg
m–2 yr–1 and 3.1 ± 0.4 μg
methyl Hg m–2 yr–1) were five
times greater than is typically reported for terrestrial wetlands.
These results indicate that in addition to the well documented contributions
of DOC, tidally driven export from mangroves represents a significant

The first site is Chalk River, Ontario, Canada, near a pit formerly used to dispose low-level wastes. The second site is the Grand River in Cambridge, south-central Ontario, which is impacted by urban activities and agriculture. Our analysis included raw water, plus fractions from ultrafiltration and solid-phase extraction (SPE). The fluorescence spectra of the NOM, resolved with PARAFAC, showed three common features: humic-like components, at excitation/emission wavelengths 325–350/450–475 nm, fulvic-like components at 325/380–420 nm and protein-like components, at 275/300 nm. Ultrafiltration revealed that most of the NOM comprised fine material below 5,000 Da cut-off ({\textless}4\% of the total) in the urban-impacted sites and the clean site at Chalk River, but the colloidal fraction (larger than 5,000 Da) was substantially higher in the contaminated water, with ∼18–26\% of the total. The protein-like components in the contaminated Chalk River water were affected by ultrafiltration, but less so in the clean Chalk River sample and the urban-impacted waters. SPE preferentially removed the protein-like component in the contaminated Chalk River water (typically 89–95\% signal decrease), but had a limited effect on humic- and fulvic-like components elsewhere. In conclusion, multiresponse fluorescence provided new information on the NOM quality from two contrasting sites, aided by ultrafiltration and SPE. These results are consistent with the in situ production of NOM in the Chalk River contaminated site, and natural production at the other sites.},

Using a general molecular DNA/RNA probe – SYBR Gold combined with differential filtration a fast, cost effective and sensitive method is presented to determine the concentration of viruses in water in situ or on-line. The approach differentiates the nucleotide size fractions that are stained with SYBR Gold to show only those associated with Viral DNA and RNA. There was a linear relationship between the fluorescence maxima for SYBR Gold added to wastewater and viral numbers determined with direct counting using epifluorescent microscopy (r2 = 0.97) and for a range of diverse natural water samples (r2 = 0.86). The method was applied to water from the tropics and Antarctica, marine and freshwater environments where natural viral abundances ranged from 106 to 108 viruses mL−1. The method takes into account the background fluorescence that represented 70\% of total fluorescence and any auto-fluorescence due to other dissolved organic carbon. While DNAse II lowered the background fluorescence associated with free DNA and RNA it could not be eliminated. The technique presented is suitable for monitoring in situ viral numbers in natural water bodies and engineered water treatment processes. This on-line viral monitoring design has the potential to replace human viral pathogen indicators.},

	abstract = {Fecal contamination of food products is a critical health issue. To test the feasibility of the use fluorescent techniques to detect fecal contamination, fluorescence excitation and emission characteristics of fecal matter from cows, deer,swine, chickens, and turkeys in the UV to far-red regions of the spectrum were evaluated. To allow the optimization of the detection of fecal contamination on animal carcasses and cut meats, emission-excitation spectra of the feces were compared with spectra for animal meats. The feedstuffs for the swine, chickens, and turkeys were also analyzed. Excitation at approximately 410 to 420 nm yielded the highest level of fluorescence for both feces and feedstuffs. Emission maxima were in the red region (at 632 nm for chicken feces and at 675 nm for the feces of the other species). The major constituent responsible for emission at 632 nm was tentatively identified as protoporphyrin IX; emission at 675 nm most likely emanates from chlorophyll a or its metabolites. Animal meats emitted strong fluorescence in the blue-green regions, but no emission peaks were observed in the red region for these meats. These results suggest that fluorescence emissions from naturally occurring chlorophyll a and its metabolites are good markers for fecal contamination and that with excitation at 410 to 420 nm, the responses of fecal matter can easily be differentiated from the responses of animal meats. We suggest that the detection of fecal contamination can be enhanced by requiring a minimum chlorophyll a content in the finishing diets of all farm animals.},

The fluorescence emission peaks for the faecal matter of animals that consume green plant materials and for chlorophyll a occur in close proximity in the red spectral region.

	abstract = {Human sewage contamination of surface waters is a major human health concern. We found urban stormwater systems that collect and convey runoff from impervious surfaces act as a conduit for sewage originating from breeches in sanitary sewer infrastructure. A total of 828 samples at 45 stormwater outfalls were collected over a four-year period and assessed by culture based methods, PCR, and quantitative PCR (qPCR) to test for traditional and alternative indicators of fecal pollution. All outfalls had the HF183 (human) Bacteroides genetic marker detected in at least one sample, suggesting sewage contamination is nearly ubiquitous in the urban environment. However, most outfalls were intermittently positive, ranging from detection in 11\%–100\% of the samples. Positive results did not correlate with seasonality, rainfall amounts, or days since previous rainfall. Approximately two-thirds of the outfalls had high ({\textgreater}5000 copy number, i.e. CN, per 100 ml) or moderate levels (1000–5000 CN per 100 ml) of the human Bacteroides genetic marker. Escherichia coli (E. coli) and enterococci levels did not correlate to human Bacteroides. A total of 66\% of all outfall samples had standard fecal indicator levels above 10,000 CFU per 100 ml. A tiered assessment using this benchmark to identify high priority sites would have failed to flag 35\% of the samples that had evidence of sewage contamination. In addition, high fecal indicators would have flagged 33\% of samples as priority that had low or no evidence of sewage. Enteric virus levels in one outfall with high levels of the human Bacteroides genetic marker were similar to untreated wastewater, which illustrates stormwater can serve as a pathway for pathogen contamination. The major source of fecal pollution at four of five river sites that receive stormwater discharge appeared to be from sewage sources rather than non-human sources based on the ratios of human Bacteroides to total Bacteroides spp. This study shows the feasibility and benefits of employing molecular methods to test for alternative indicators of fecal pollution to identify sewage sources and potential health risks and for prioritization of remediation efforts.},

	abstract = {The spectral characteristics of whole water dissolved organic matter (DOM) and fulvic acid were studied in samples collected from an alpine lake, a subalpine lake, and a subalpine stream during snowmelt and the summer growing season. Excitation-emission matrices of whole water DOM and fulvic acid were analyzed by parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). Allochthonous inputs of terrestrially derived fulvic acid DOM were dominant during snowmelt at the alpine lake, and during both snowmelt and summer at the subalpine sites. At the alpine lake, autochthonous inputs of DOM dominated during the summer phytoplankton bloom, and the spectral characteristics of the whole water DOM diverged from those of the fulvic acid. For example, the quinone-like fluorophores in whole water DOM at the alpine lake were more oxidized and microbially derived than the fulvic acid fraction during the summer. At the subalpine sites, the seasonal changes in the source and redox state of the quinone-like fluorophores of the whole water DOM tracked those of the fulvic acid pool. However, at both lake sites there was a greater contribution of amino acid-like fluorophores in the whole water DOM than the fulvic acid fraction. This trend was not observed at the subalpine stream site. Principal components analysis (PCA) of the PARAFAC components suggests that during snowmelt, the chemical quality of the DOM at the alpine lake was similar to that of the subalpine stream; whereas the alpine site was more similar to the subalpine lake during the summer. Spectral characterization and PCA of the PARAFAC components suggest that nonhumic quinone-like and amino acid-like fluorophores were produced in the alpine lake during the summer phytoplankton bloom. Our results show that different types of water bodies produce different seasonal patterns in whole water DOM and fulvic acid quantity and quality.},

	abstract = {Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR), UV absorbance and excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy were used to define the chemical characteristics of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in whole and C18 extracted rainwater. The average total recovery of fluorescence determined from the sum of extract and filtrate fractions relative to the whole was 86\% suggesting that 14\% of fluorescent CDOM in rainwater is comprised of very hydrophobic material that cannot be eluted from the column. Half the fluorescence of rainwater was recovered in the filtrate fraction which is important because it suggests that 50\% of the chromophoric material present in precipitation is relatively hydrophilic. The average spectral slope coefficient was smaller in extracted samples (16.3 ± 9.0 μm-1) relative to whole samples (18.9 ± 2.8 μm-1) suggesting that the extracted material contains larger molecular weight material. Approximately one-third of the total dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in rainwater exists in the extract fraction suggesting that a large percentage of the uncharacterized DOC in rainwater can be accounted for by these hydrophobic macromolecular species. The fluorescence of extracted samples is strongly correlated with total NMR integration and is most sensitive to aromatic protons suggesting that molecules in this region are the most important in controlling the optical properties of rainwater. The lower removal efficiency of CDOM in rainwater relative to surface waters or the water-soluble fraction of aerosols during solid phase extraction (SPE) suggests that rainwater contains significantly more hydrophilic chromophoric compounds which are compositionally different than found in these other aquatic matrices. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The decoupling of δ15NNO3 and δ18ONO3 isotopes suggests that algal assimilation and denitrification are not major processes controlling diurnal NO3− variability in the San Joaquin River during the study. The lack of a clear explanation for NO3− variability likely reflects a combination of riverine biological processes and time-varying physical transport of NO3− from upstream agricultural drains to the mainstem San Joaquin River. 4. The application of an in situ optical NO3− sensor along with discrete samples provides a view into the fine temporal structure of hydrochemical data and may allow for greater accuracy in pollution assessment.},

	abstract = {Floods, hurricanes, and longer-term changes in climate and land use can have profound effects on water quality due to shifts in hydrologic flow paths, water residence time, precipitation patterns, connectivity between rivers and uplands, and many other factors. In order to understand and respond to changes in hydrology and water quality, resource managers and policy makers have a need for accurate and early indicators, as well as the ability to assess possible mechanisms and likely outcomes. In-situ optical sensors-those making continuous measurements of constituents by absorbance or fluorescence properties in the environment at timescales of minutes to years-have a long history in oceanography for developing highly resolved concentrations and fluxes, but are not commonly used in freshwater systems. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) has developed the Aquatic Real-Time Monitoring Network, with high-resolution optical data collection for organic carbon, nutrients, and sediment in large coastal rivers, along with continuous measurements of discharge, water temperature, and dissolved inorganic carbon. The collecting of continuous water-quality data in the Nation?s waterways has revealed temporal trends and spatial patterns in constituents that traditional sampling approaches fail to capture, and will serve a critical role in monitoring, assessment and decision-making in a rapidly changing landscape.},

	title = {In situ optical water-quality sensor networks - {Workshop} summary report},
	url = {http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2012/1044/},
	abstract = {Advanced in situ optical water-quality sensors and new techniques for data analysis hold enormous promise for furthering scientific understanding of aquatic systems. These sensors measure important biogeochemical parameters for long deployments, enabling the capture of data at time scales over which they vary most meaningfully. The high-frequency, real-time water-quality data they generate provide opportunities for early warning of water-quality deterioration, trend detection, and science-based decision support. However, developing networks of optical sensors in freshwater systems that report reliable and comparable data across and between sites remains a challenge to the research and monitoring community. To address this, the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc. (CUAHSI) convened a joint 3-day workshop (June 8-10, 2011) at the National Conservation Training Center in Shepardstown, West Virginia, to explore ways to coordinate development of standards and applications for optical sensors, and improve handling, storing, and analyzing the continuous data they produce. The workshop brought together more than 60 scientists, program managers, and vendors from universities, government agencies, and the private sector. Several important outcomes emerged from the presentations and breakout sessions. There was general consensus that making intercalibrated measurements requires that both manufacturers and users better characterize and calibrate the sensors under field conditions. For example, the influence of suspended particles, highly colored water, and temperature on optical sensors remains poorly understood, but consistently accounting for these factors is critical to successful deployment and for interpreting results in different settings. This, in turn, highlights the lack of appropriate standards for sensor calibrations, field checks, and characterizing interferences, as well as methods for data validation, treatment, and analysis of resulting measurements. Participants discussed a wide range of logistical considerations for successful sensor deployments, including key physical infrastructure, data loggers, and remote-communication techniques. Tools to manage, assure, and control quality, and explore large streams of continuous water-quality data are being developed by the USGS, CUAHSI, and other organizations, and will be critical to making full use of these highfrequency data for research and monitoring.},

	abstract = {The recent commercial availability of in situ optical sensors, together with new techniques for data collection and analysis, provides the opportunity to monitor a wide range of water-quality constituents on time scales in which environmental conditions actually change. Of particular interest is the application of ultraviolet (UV) photometers for in situ determination of nitrate concentrations in rivers and streams. The variety of UV nitrate sensors currently available differ in several important ways related to instrument design that affect the accuracy of their nitrate concentration measurements in different types of natural waters. This report provides information about selection and use of UV nitrate sensors by the U.S. Geological Survey to facilitate the collection of high-quality data across studies, sites, and instrument types. For those in need of technical background and information about sensor selection, this report addresses the operating principles, key features and sensor design, sensor characterization techniques and typical interferences, and approaches for sensor deployment. For those needing information about maintaining sensor performance in the field, key sections in this report address maintenance and calibration protocols, quality-assurance techniques, and data formats and reporting. Although the focus of this report is UV nitrate sensors, many of the principles can be applied to other in situ optical sensors for water-quality studies.},

Both MST methods detected substantial human-origin pollution at the two beaches, in locations producing consistently high levels of Enterococcus spp. Investigations by municipal officials led to the fluorometric detection and subsequent repair of sewage infrastructure problems at both beaches. The success of the mitigation efforts was confirmed during the summer of 2005 using ARA and fluorometry, with the results cross-validated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE).},

	abstract = {In a continuing effort to develop inexpensive source tracking methods to detect human fecal contamination in environmental waters, targeted sampling was combined with fluorometry. Targeted sampling works by identifying hot spots of fecal contamination through multiple samplings over ever-decreasing distances. Fluorometry identifies human fecal contamination by detecting optical brighteners, primarily from laundry detergents. Because organic matter fluoresces and interferes with fluorometry, two locations were chosen for sampling: waters relatively low in organic matter at Mayagüez Bay, Puerto Rico, and waters relatively high in organic matter at St. Simons Island, Georgia. In Puerto Rico, targeted sampling and fluorometry quickly and easily identified two hot spots of human fecal contamination in the Yagüez River, which flows through the city of Mayagüez. Another source tracking method, detection of theesp gene, confirmed their human origin. On St. Simous Island, targeted sampling and fiuorometry identified two hot spots of potential human fecal contamination. Detection of theesp gene confirmed the human origin of one site but not the other, most likely because background organic matter fluorescence interfered with fhiorometry. A separate experiment showed that adding a 436-um emission filter to the fluorometer reduced this background fluorescence by {\textgreater} 50\%. With the 436-nm Filter in place, another sampling was conducted on St. Simons Island, and the second hot spot was identified as fecal contamination from birds. As long as the fluorometer was equipped with a 436-nm filter and organic matter concentrations were considered, targeted sampling combined with fluorometry was a relatively inexpensive method for identifying human fecal contamination in water.},

	abstract = {Detection of optical brighteners by fluorometry combined with ultraviolet light (UV) exposure has been proposed as an inexpensive method for detection of human fecal contamination, but has received limited testing. This study evaluated the approach in southern California by applying it to a variety of detergents, sewage and septage samples from the region, as well as to natural stream water as a negative control. The concept of using UV exposure to differentiate fluorescence from natural organic matter proved valid, as the method produced no false positives. However, the method failed to detect half of the detergents tested in natural stream water at 5 μL/L, due to its conservative thresholds. This study identified a method modification that provides greater sensitivity by taking advantage of differences in the shape of photodecay curves between optical brighteners and natural organic matter. This method modification resulted in detection of all detergents, sewage at 1:10 dilution and septage at 1:100 dilution. Several caveats for its use remain, including our observation that the optical brightener signal degraded rapidly in strong sunlight. Additionally, there was low sensitivity for some environmentally friendly detergents, which does not present a problem on a community basis where a mix of detergents are used, but could be of concern for assessing septic inputs from individual homes. Still, the method is simple to employ in the field, yields rapid results and is useful as a low-cost initial screening tool.},

Through experiments we have carried out sensing probes which have been developed, comprising optical fibers that use the evanescent field of the guided energy. The movement of water through dry sand was simulated in the laboratory and the sensors were used in situ to measure the variation of soil moisture in real time. A similar experiment simulated the movement of an organic liquid (mineral oil) through water-saturated sand, and the sensors were used in situ to monitor the hydrocarbon movement. We found that a hydrophobic polymer-coated waveguide can amplify the hydrocarbon signal while minimizing that of water, making it possible to detect a dissolved hydrocarbon. Tests show that the second derivative transform of the absorption spectra could be used to distinguish classes of hydrocarbons.},

Pattern recognition techniques were successfully applied to map contaminant plumes surrounding waste disposal sites. Remediation activities at a former gas plant site were monitored using a sensor system based on time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. Tracer investigations in the saturated and unsaturated zone were enhanced due to the small time intervals between the single measurements.

A sandy soil (TR) and a sandy-clay soil with a relatively high montmorillonite content (A) were treated with the diverse OA. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) was extracted from the amendments, the soils, and the amended soils and studied by fluorescence spectroscopy. A humification index (HIX) was calculated from the fluorescence data. Sorption was determined with the batch technique. Spectroscopical studies revealed that the DOM of the LF differs from the other OA by having a very low ability to absorb and to fluoresce and by its very low HIX values, which indicates that the LF contains large amounts of nonhumified material and consists of small molecules. On the other hand, the SF amendment contains the highest amounts of highly humified material and a large number of carboxylic groups. Amended soils sorbed simazine and 2,4-D to a greater extent than the untreated soils, except in the case of simazine sorption in the LF amended soil A, which had a lower simazine sorption than the original soil. The small molecules of DOM in the LF compete with simazine for montmorillonite sorption sites in soil A. This is not the case for 2,4-D, since this herbicide does not sorb on montmorillonite. In the case of the soil TR, with a lower montmorillonite content, there is no competition between simazine and the LF molecules for sorption sites. Soils amended with the highly humified SF were the best sorbents for simazine but not for 2,4-D, which can be attributed to repulsion between negatively charged 2,4-D molecules and COO- groups, which are more abundant in SF.},

	abstract = {Willow Slough, a seasonally irrigated agricultural watershed in the Sacramento River valley, California, was sampled weekly in 2006 in order to investigate seasonal concentrations and compositions of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Average DOC concentrations nearly doubled from winter baseflow (2.75 mg L−1) to summer irrigation (5.14 mg L−1), while a concomitant increase in carbon-normalized vanillyl phenols (0.11 mg 100 mg OC−1 increasing to 0.31 mg 100 mg OC−1, on average) indicates that this additional carbon is likely vascular plant-derived. A strong linear relationship between lignin concentration and total suspended sediments (r2 = 0.79) demonstrates that agricultural management practices that mobilize sediments will likely have a direct and significant impact on DOC composition. The original source of vascular plant-derived DOC to Willow Slough appears to be the same throughout the year as evidenced by similar syringyl to vanillyl and cinnamyl to vanillyl ratios. However, differing diagenetic pathways during winter baseflow as compared to the rest of the year are evident in acid to aldehyde ratios of both vanillyl and syringyl phenols. The chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption coefficient at 350 nm showed a strong correlation with lignin concentration (r2 = 0.83). Other CDOM measurements related to aromaticity and molecular weight also showed correlations with carbon-normalized yields (e.g. specific UV absorbance at 254 nm (r2 = 0.57) and spectral slope (r2 = 0.54)). Our overall findings suggest that irrigated agricultural watersheds like Willow Slough can potentially have a significant impact on mainstem DOC concentration and composition when scaled to the entire watershed of the main tributary.},

Dual NO3− isotopes (δ15NNO3 and δ18ONO3) and dissolved oxygen isotopes (δ18ODO) were measured over 2 days to assess NO3− sources and biogeochemical controls over diurnal time-scales. 2. Concerted temporal patterns of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations and δ18ODO were consistent with photosynthesis, respiration and atmospheric O2 exchange, providing evidence of diurnal biological processes independent of river discharge. 3. Surface water NO3− concentrations varied by up to 22\% over a single diurnal cycle and up to 31\% over the 5-day study, but did not reveal concerted diurnal patterns at a frequency comparable to DO concentrations. The decoupling of δ15NNO3 and δ18ONO3 isotopes suggests that algal assimilation and denitrification are not major processes controlling diurnal NO3− variability in the San Joaquin River during the study. The lack of a clear explanation for NO3− variability likely reflects a combination of riverine biological processes and time-varying physical transport of NO3− from upstream agricultural drains to the mainstem San Joaquin River. 4. The application of an in situ optical NO3− sensor along with discrete samples provides a view into the fine temporal structure of hydrochemical data and may allow for greater accuracy in pollution assessment.},

	abstract = {Lignin phenols have proven to be powerful biomarkers in environmental studies; however, the complexity of lignin analysis limits the number of samples and thus spatial and temporal resolution in any given study. In contrast, spectrophotometric characterization of dissolved organic matter (DOM) is rapid, noninvasive, relatively inexpensive, requires small sample volumes, and can even be measured in situ to capture fine-scale temporal and spatial detail of DOM cycling. Here we present a series of cross-validated Partial Least Squares models that use fluorescence properties of DOM to explain up to 91\% of lignin compositional and concentration variability in samples collected seasonally over 2 years in the Sacramento River/San Joaquin River Delta in California, United States. These models were subsequently used to predict lignin composition and concentration from fluorescence measurements collected during a diurnal study in the San Joaquin River. While modeled lignin composition remained largely unchanged over the diurnal cycle, changes in modeled lignin concentrations were much greater than expected and indicate that the sensitivity of fluorescence-based proxies for lignin may prove invaluable as a tool for selecting the most informative samples for detailed lignin characterization. With adequate calibration, similar models could be used to significantly expand our ability to study sources and processing of DOM in complex surface water systems.},

	abstract = {We used high-resolution in situ measurements of turbidity and fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) to quantitatively estimate the tidally driven exchange of mercury (Hg) between the waters of the San Francisco estuary and Browns Island, a tidal wetland. Turbidity and FDOM—representative of particle-associated and filter-passing Hg, respectively—together predicted 94 \% of the observed variability in measured total mercury concentration in unfiltered water samples (UTHg) collected during a single tidal cycle in spring, fall, and winter, 2005–2006. Continuous in situ turbidity and FDOM data spanning at least a full spring-neap period were used to generate UTHg concentration time series using this relationship, and then combined with water discharge measurements to calculate Hg fluxes in each season. Wetlands are generally considered to be sinks for sediment and associated mercury. However, during the three periods of monitoring, Browns Island wetland did not appreciably accumulate Hg. Instead, gradual tidally driven export of UTHg from the wetland offset the large episodic on-island fluxes associated with high wind events. Exports were highest during large spring tides, when ebbing waters relatively enriched in FDOM, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and filter-passing mercury drained from the marsh into the open waters of the estuary. On-island flux of UTHg, which was largely particle-associated, was highest during strong winds coincident with flood tides. Our results demonstrate that processes driving UTHg fluxes in tidal wetlands encompass both the dissolved and particulate phases and multiple timescales, necessitating longer term monitoring to adequately quantify fluxes.},

	abstract = {Abstract Understanding the sources of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in drinking-water reservoirs is an important management issue because DOC may form disinfection by-products, interfere with disinfection, or increase treatment costs. DOC may be derived from a host of sources—algal production of DOC in the reservoir, marginal production of DOC from mucks and vascular plants at the margins, and sediments in the reservoir. The purpose of this study was to assess if release of DOC from reservoir sediments containing ferric chloride coagulant was a significant source of DOC to the reservoir. We examined the source-specific contributions of DOC using a profiling system to measure the in situ distribution of optical properties of absorption and fluorescence at various locations in the reservoir. Vertical optical profiles were coupled with discrete water samples measured in the laboratory for DOC concentration and optical properties: absorption spectra and excitation emission matrix spectra (EEMs). Modeling the in situ optical data permitted estimation of the bulk DOC profile in the reservoir as well as separation into source-specific contributions. Analysis of the source-specific profiles and their associated optical characteristics indicated that the sedimentary source of DOC to the reservoir is significant and that this DOC is labile in the reservoir. We conclude that optical profiling is a useful technique for understanding complex biogeochemical processes in a reservoir.},

	abstract = {Dissolved organic matter (DOM) dynamics during storm events has received considerable attention in forested watersheds, but the extent to which storms impart rapid changes in DOM concentration and composition in highly disturbed agricultural watersheds remains poorly understood. In this study, we used identical in situ optical sensors for DOM fluorescence (FDOM) with and without filtration to continuously evaluate surface water DOM dynamics in a 415 km2 agricultural watershed over a 4 week period containing a short-duration rainfall event. Peak turbidity preceded peak discharge by 4 h and increased by over 2 orders of magnitude, while the peak filtered FDOM lagged behind peak turbidity by 15 h. FDOM values reported using the filtered in situ fluorometer increased nearly fourfold and were highly correlated with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations (r2 = 0.97), providing a highly resolved proxy for DOC throughout the study period. Discrete optical properties including specific UV absorbance (SUVA254), spectral slope (S290–350), and fluorescence index (FI) were also strongly correlated with in situ FDOM and indicate a shift toward aromatic, high molecular weight DOM from terrestrially derived sources during the storm. The lag of the peak in FDOM behind peak discharge presumably reflects the draining of watershed soils from natural and agricultural landscapes. Field and experimental evidence showed that unfiltered FDOM measurements underestimated filtered FDOM concentrations by up to ∼60\% at particle concentrations typical of many riverine systems during hydrologic events. Together, laboratory and in situ data provide insights into the timing and magnitude of changes in DOM quantity and quality during storm events in an agricultural watershed, and indicate the need for sample filtration in systems with moderate to high suspended sediment loads.},

Our work presented here extends the use of fluorescence spectrometry for determining conditional stability constants for such complexes. We combine the use of excitation?emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectrometry and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) to determine the stability constants of the chemically meaningful components modeled by PARAFAC. Water-soluble organic matter (WSOM) from O-horizon soils of deciduous and coniferous forest stands were extracted and titrated at pH = 4.7 with iron(III) (Fe) and aluminum (Al) which are important metals in acid soil systems. The EEM spectra were then recorded and PARAFAC analysis showed that the WSOM contained three humic-substance-like components. Fe titration led to fluorescence quenching of the three components, while Al titration enhanced fluorescence for two components and quenched one of the components. The average Ryan?Weber stability constants at pH 4.7 ranged from log K of 4.28 to 4.91 for Fe and 4.84 to 5.96 for Al. The conditional stability constants were similar for Fe binding for deciduous and coniferous stand-derived WSOM, while they were stronger for Al binding with coniferous stand-derived WSOM. This difference in binding strengths for Al may affect the chemical behavior of Al in soil and aquatic systems. Determining the individual binding parameters of organic matter components with metals represents a significant advance over current approaches that utilize fluorescence quenching at a single excitation?emission wavelength pair to characterize organic matter?metal interactions.},

Thirteen components likely representing groups of similarly fluorescing moieties were found to explain the variation in this data set. Seven of the thirteen components were identified as quinone-like based on comparison of their excitation and emission spectra to spectra of model quinones. These quinone-like fluorophores were found to vary in redox state and degree of conjugation. Two components were identified as amino acid-like based on comparison to tyrosine and tryptophan fluorescence spectra. The other four components are not yet associated with any class of molecules. The quinone-like fluorophores account for about 50\% of the fluorescence for every sample analyzed, showing that quinone-like fluorophores are an important and ubiquitous fluorescing moiety and in natural waters. Further, the distribution of the quinone-like fluorophores was evaluated as a function of environmental and laboratory redox gradients. Under reducing conditions, the contribution of the reduced quinone-like fluorophores increased concurrent with a decrease in the oxidized quinone-like fluorophores, indicating that DOM fluorescence is a function of redox state of quinone-like moieties. Lastly, a ratio of two quinone-like fluorophores was found to explain the variation in the fluorescence index. These results provide new insight into the redox reactivity of DOM and have implications for the application of fluorescence spectroscopy as a tool to characterize DOM.},

During method development experiments, TOC, DOC, and SUVA were determined for seven source waters using five instrument types. Mean values for DOC, TOC, and SUVA ranged from 0.42 to 3.38 mg/L, 0.42 to 3.64 mg/L, and 1.95 to 3.37 L/mg-m, respectively, with pooled fortified recoveries of 102.7±1.8\%.

	abstract = {Organic matter dissolved in the percolation water of forest soils contributes largely to element cycling and transport of natural and anthropogenic compounds. The way and extent to which these processes are affected depends on the amount and the chemical composition of soluble organic matter. Because the amount of soluble organic matter varies seasonally with changes in the microbial activity in soil, it seems reasonable to assume that there may be also seasonal changes in the chemical composition of dissolved organic matter. We examined dissolved organic matter in the seepage waters of organic forest floor layers over a 27-month period (1997-1999) in two forest ecosystems, a 160-year-old Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stand and a 90-year-old European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forest. The forest floor leachates were analysed for bulk dissolved organic C, C in hydrophilic and hydrophobic dissolved organic matter fractions, lignin-derived phenols (CuO oxidation), hydrolysable neutral carbohydrates and uronic acids, hydrolysable amino sugars, and stable carbon isotope composition. In addition, we studied the samples by use of liquid-state $^{\textrm{13}}$C-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. For both investigated forest sites we found that the dissolved organic carbon concentrations in forest floor leachates were largest during summer. They peaked after rain storms following short dry periods (106-145 mg dissolved organic Cl$^{\textrm{-1}}$). The proportions of C in the hydrophilic fractions were largest in winter and spring whereas in summer and autumn more C was found in the hydrophobic fraction. According to liquid-state $^{\textrm{13}}$C-NMR spectroscopy, summer and autumn samples had larger abundances of aromatic and aliphatic structures as well as larger proportions of carboxyl groups whereas the winter and spring samples were dominated by resonances indicating carbohydrates. Wet-chemical analyses confirmed these results. Winter and spring samples were rich in neutral carbohydrates and amino sugars. The summer and autumn samples contained more lignin-derived phenols which were also stronger oxidised than those in the winter and spring samples. Seasonal changes of δ $^{\textrm{13}}$C values were found to reflect the changes in the chemical composition of dissolved organic matter. Most negative values occurred when isotopically light lignin-derived compounds were abundant and less negative values when carbohydrates predominated. The different vegetation, age of the stands, and underlying mineral soils resulted in different concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and in differences in the distribution between hydrophobic and hydrophilic organic carbon. Despite of this, the results suggest that the trends in temporal variations in the composition of dissolved organic matter in forest floor seepage water were remarkably similar for both sites. Dissolved organic matter in winter and spring seems to be mainly controlled by leaching of fresh disrupted biomass debris with a large contribution of bacterial and fungal-derived carbohydrates and amino sugars. Dissolved organic matter leached from the forest floor in summer and autumn is controlled by the decomposition processes in the forest floor resulting in the production of strongly oxidised, water-soluble aromatic and aliphatic compounds. The chemical composition of dissolved organic matter in forest floor seepage water in winter and spring indicates larger mobility, larger biodegradability, and less interaction with metals and organic pollutants than that released during summer and autumn. Thus, the impact of dissolved organic matter on transport processes may vary throughout the year due to changes in its composition.},

	abstract = {Dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition may be an important determinant of its fate in freshwaters, but little is known about temporal variability in DOM composition and the biodegradability of DOM in northern temperate watersheds. We measured biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) via incubation assays and DOM composition using optical indices on 11 dates in three Lake Superior tributaries. Percent BDOC (\%BDOC) and BDOC concentrations were seasonally synchronous across these watersheds, despite that they vary in size by orders of magnitude (1.7 to 3400 km2). Relative to \%BDOC, BDOC concentrations were more tightly constrained among sites on any given date. BDOC also varied within seasons; for example, \%BDOC on two different dates in winter were among the highest (29\% and 54\%) and lowest (0\%) values observed for each site (overall \%BDOC range: 0 to 72\%). DOM composition varied the most among tributaries during a summer storm event when BDOC (both as percent and concentration) was elevated but was remarkably similar among tributaries during fall, spring, and winter. Multivariate models identified humic-like and tryptophan-like fluorophores as predictors of \%BDOC, but DOM composition only described 21\% of the overall variation in \%BDOC. Collectively, these three rivers exported 18 Gg C yr−1 as DOC and 2 Gg C yr−1 as BDOC, which corresponded to 9 to 17\% of annual DOC exported in biodegradable form. Our results suggest much of the C exported from these northern temperate watersheds may be biodegradable within 28 days and that large pulses of labile DOM can be exported during storm events and spring snowmelt.},
