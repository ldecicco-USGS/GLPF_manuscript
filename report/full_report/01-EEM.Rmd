# EEM plot {#EEM}

Maybe we want to show a particular EEM plot...such as Figure \@ref(fig:eem-example).

```{r eem-example, fig.cap="Here is a EEM plot.", echo=FALSE}
print(EEMplot)

```

Pretty neat.

Here's the base-R figure (\@ref(fig:base-r)):

```{r base-r, fig.cap="Lachno vs HumBac"}
base_plot(summaryDF)

```
