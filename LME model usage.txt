LME models usage

1. Groups are defined (sites) that may have some form of variable relation between response and predictor variables.
2. Fixed effects are variables that have the same coefficient among all groups
3. Random effects are variables that can have different coefficients among groups 
       (represented inside the parentheses with "|" or "||" included).
4. Adding (1 | group) will change the intercept among different groups (random intercept with fixed mean)
5. Adding (predictor | group) will change the coefficient and the intercept among groups:
       x + (x | g) 1 + x + (1 + x | g) Correlated random
intercept and slope.
6. ||  x + (x || g) -> 1 + x + (1 | g) + (0 + x | g) Uncorrelated random intercept and slope.
