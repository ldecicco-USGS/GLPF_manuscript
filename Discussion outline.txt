Discussion outline

Occurrence and concentrations of HIB and FIB and implications
HIB
	-magnitude at diff sites and scales
	-evidence for indicator of sewage from this study
	-compare to evidence of sewage from previous studies

FIB
	-lack of evidence for sewage indicator in current study
	-lack of evidence for pathogen indicator in previous studies
	-prevalence of use in permits and recreational use: epi studies that indicate increased sickness
	-

Regressions
	-Site groupings and implications
	-Small scale: doesn’t work. Reasons and implications
	-Current sensors vs new sensors. Some incremental improvements may be made, but it isn’t likely that large improvements would be achieved. Correlation among many signals.
